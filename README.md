# About
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where you and your opponent (the computer) simultaneously choose one of the following three options: "rock", "paper" or "scissors"
# Rules
The rules are as follows:

▸Rock beats scissors (the scissors get broken by the rock)
                        
▸Scissors beats paper (the paper gets cut by the scissors) 

▸Paper beats rock (the paper covers the rock)
 
▸The winner is the player whose choice beats the choice of his opponent.
